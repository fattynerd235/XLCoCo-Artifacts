# XLCoCo-Artifacts


### Package to Install
requirements.txt file is provided. We use Python 3.12.3 to develop the XLCoCo replication package. To install the package one need to execute the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


### Dataset
As the dataset files are enormous in size, we stored our dataset on Kaggle. You'll need to execute DatasetDownload.py to download the dataset used for the experiment. You will get access to our experimental data as well.

### Feature Extractor
This is developed in Java with Antlr V4. All the parser-related files and dependent jar files are provided. At present, feature extractor needs to be run individually.
